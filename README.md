# MediaSearchEngine
### Objective
This project was supposed to implement concepts learned from our Text Information Systems class. My team and I decided to build a search engine web app that would use the IMDB API to display information about the requested piece of media (movie or TV show) and then generate recommendations based off of that specific media.
### Description
The project was written as a Django web application with python in the backend and HTML/CSS as the front end. We utilized the IMDB API to request information about a piece of media and then display selected information on an information page. The recommender system used generes as the core indicator of displaying recommendations (the more genre tag matches, the more likely that it is a good recommendation). The project took a collective 80-100 hours over 3 months.
 ### Technology
 - HTML/CSS/ to develop 
 - Python3 as the base language
 - Django for web intergration
 - SQLite3 for the database 
### To Do
 - Cleaner UI design
 - More complex recommender system
 - Using different API to generate more information
